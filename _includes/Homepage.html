        I am a fisheries ecologist, with interests in fish life-history, ecophysiology and quantitative modeling. Currently, I am a post-doctoral research associate at Virginia Institute of Marine Science. For this position, I am conducting research in three main areas:
		<ol>
  <li>Effects of temperature and salinity on metabolic rate and consumption rate of invasive blue catfish.</li>
  <li>Spatiotemporal changes in recruitment characteristics of striped bass in tidal rivers of Chesapeake Bay.</li>
  <li>Effects of protected areas on taxonomic and functional diversity of fishes in Nepal.</li>
</ol>
	</p>

		In this website, I will provide updates on my research, teaching philosophy and random data analysis scripts. The scripts are just as much for my future self, as for others. Have a look around the website and let me know if you have any questions, comments or suggestions. I can be reached at </p>
