		I am a fisheries ecologist, with interests in fish life-history, ecophysiology and quantitative modeling. Currently, I am a post-doctoral research associate at Virginia Institute of Marine Science. For this position, I am conducting research in three main areas:
		<ol>
  <li>Effects of temperature and salinity on metabolic rate and consumption rate of invasive blue catfish.</li>
  <li>Spatiotemporal changes in recruitment characteristics of striped bass in tidal rivers of Chesapeake Bay.</li>
  <li>Effects of protected areas on taxonomic and functional diversity of fishes in Nepal.</li>
</ol>
	</p>

		In this website, I will provide updates on my research, teaching philosophy and random data analysis scripts. The scripts are just as much for my future self, as for others. Have a look around the website and let me know if you have any questions, comments or suggestions. I can be reached via email at vaskarnepal@gmail.com or via twitter at @NepalVaskar

			Vaskar Nepal is a Post-doctoral Research Associate at Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), William & Mary. Vaskar is a fisheries biologist who completed his PhD in 2020, studying the invasion ecology of blue catfish with Dr. Mary Fabrizio at VIMS. Following his Ph.D., he remained at VIMS for his post-doctoral fellowship with Drs. Mary Fabrizio and Troy Tuckey. Vaskar's research focuses on combining life-history information from the wild with laboratory experiments and quantitative techniques to inform management and conservation of aquatic fauna.
